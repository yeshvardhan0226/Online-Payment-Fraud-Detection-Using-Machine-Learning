Project Overview
This project aims to detect fraudulent online payment transactions using Machine Learning. Utilizing a Random Forest Classifier trained on real transaction data, the model predicts fraud based on transaction patterns and financial features.

Description:
Leveraging advanced machine learning, this project uncovers hidden patterns in online payment data to detect fraud with exceptional precision. By analyzing transaction behaviors and account dynamics, the robust Random Forest model delivers near-perfect accuracy, empowering financial systems to combat evolving fraudulent threats in real time.

The workflow includes:

Data preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature engineering

Model training

Model evaluation

Visualizing results

This project empowers financial institutions to spot suspicious activities and minimize losses from fraud.
